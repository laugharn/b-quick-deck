January 15, 2019
---
## Tools Discussed

* Yarn Workspaces
* Next.js
* Hooks
* Tailwind
* purgeCSS
* Zeit Now
---
## Philosophy

Complexity and fragility are the enemy.
---
## Yarn Workspaces

### JavaScript monorepos made easy...er.

https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/
---
## Next.js

### A React framework that Just Works

https://nextjs.org
---
## Why Next.js

* The universe arcs towards frameworks
* Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
* HMR, Webpack, Babel, env variables, etc.
* Robust ecosystem
---
## Hooks

### RIP Lifecycle
---
## Hooks Demos

* useState
* useReducer
* useEffect
* Final Form
---
## useState

### Get reactive, stateful values without classes

```js
export default () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

    return <button onClick={e => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```
---
## useReducer

### If you love Redux for some reason

```js
const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
    // Imagine a reducer here
}

export default ()=> {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0)

    // Imagine buttons that dispatch actions
}
```
---
## useEffect
---
## Final Form

### How third parties are using hooks

```js
export default () => {
    const { form, handleSubmit, pristine, submitting, values } = useForm({
        onSubmit, // A submit function
        validate // A validator
    })

    const firstName = useField('username', form)
    const lastName = useField('password', form)

    // Imagine a form
}
```

## Tailwind
---
## purgeCSS

### Marie Kondo for your stylesheets
---
## Why purgeCSS?

* What treeshaking does for JavaScript, purgeCSS does for CSS
* Don't worry about how big your library is
